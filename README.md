# Advanced Physical Design 

## Table of conents
Part 1:

## Introduction
RTL to GDSII flow for a picorv32 which is RISCV based core. The objecive will be to use he RTL code and implement the following steps to obtain the GDS file.
+ Synthesis
+ Floorplan
+ Placement
+ Clock Tree Synthesis
+ Routing

All tools used in this project are open sourced
+ OpenLANE
+ SKY130 PDK
+ Magic
+ Ngspice
+ OpenSTA

## Methodology
<h2>Part 1: Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK</h2>

<h2>Part 2: Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and Introduction to library cells</h2>
