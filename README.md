## Introduction
RTL to GDSII flow for a picorv32 which is RISCV based core. The objecive will be to use he RTL code and implement the following steps to obtain the GDS file.
+ Synthesis
+ Floorplan
+ Placement
+ Clock Tree Synthesis
+ Routing

## Tools Used
All tools used in this project are open sourced
